      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I am Sagnik, presently in my fourth year of BS-MS at IISER Kolkata. I am a Physics major and interested in Theoretical Condensed Matter and Quantum Information. I also like some Math&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;but not with much rigour (huh, typical physicist tendency perhaps?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like to laugh a lot and have watched quite a few comedy series. Few of my favourite are Malcolm in the Middle, Arrested Development, Only Murders in the Building and anything with Philomean Cunk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
