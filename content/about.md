Hi! I am Sagnik, presently in my fourth year of BS-MS at IISER Kolkata. I am a Physics major and interested in Theoretical Condensed Matter and Quantum Information. I also like some Math......but not with much rigour (huh, typical physicist tendency perhaps?). 


I like to laugh a lot and have watched quite a few comedy series. Few of my favourite are Malcolm in the Middle, Arrested Development, Only Murders in the Building and anything with Philomena Cunk.

Many describe me as a bit eccentric (which is fine I guess). In my free time, I like to listen to music, specially Rabindrasangeet and Bengali folk songs. I can sing okayish and have been known to sing awkwardly at strange places like the washroom......

Other things about me which are probably not of much use......

I use Arch, btw. For coding purposes, I mainly use Julia. I am a leftie. I don't have much interest in sports/politics (things people tend to discuss the most). Long ago, I used to like painting, and nowadays I sometimes doodle (which is kinda evident from the random doodles here). And I really like to talk gibberish sometimes!
